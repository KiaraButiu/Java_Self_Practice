/* Use `String methods` to determine if the prefix is found again somewhere later in the String.
A prefix is the set of characters in the beginning of the String. To determine how long the
prefix is,  use the given `n` value. For example, if `n` is 2, the prefix is the first two
characters, so you would check if the String from the 3rd character until the end has those two
character repeating anywhere. Output the result as a `boolean value, true or false`. */
